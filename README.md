# Binary Trees Project

## Overview

This project focuses on understanding and implementing various aspects of binary trees in the C programming language. The primary objectives include gaining knowledge about binary trees, Binary Search Trees (BST), and related concepts, as well as implementing specific functionalities.

## Team Members
- Soufiane Bibeche

## Project Duration

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, participants are expected to:

- Understand the concept of a binary tree.
- Differentiate between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree (BST).
- Evaluate the time complexity gains compared to linked lists.
- Define the terms depth, height, and size of a binary tree.
- Implement different traversal methods for binary trees.
- Comprehend complete, full, perfect, and balanced binary trees.

## Tasks

Participants are required to solve tasks related to binary trees, and each task contributes to achieving the learning objectives outlined above. The project encourages participants to implement various functionalities and gain hands-on experience in working with binary tree structures.
